# Hepburn [AUYH], the cloud computing crypto and service!



Introducing Hepburn, the cryptocurrency and service built on the purpose of being an ally to Bitcoin and the source 
of stability for many other cryptos. The crypto market is extremely volatile and prone to the biggest change from 
even the smallest words coming from the mouth. Elon Musk has proved this multiple times with both Bitcoin and Dogecoin. 
Take Ravencoin: it was hacked in 2018 and with it came a disruption (a minting of +5% and mass inflation) that derailed a
potential challenger to Bitcoin.

That is the purpose of Hepburn.

Inspired and built on the foundations of Amazon Web Services and Internet Computer,
Hepburn is a fully fledged security based token and service that will work constantly both through automation and user updates to provide 
both investors and founders peace of mind and free of the volatile and sudden movement of the markets as well as the cybersecurity threat 
to their assets.
